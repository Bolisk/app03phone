## Natural Numbers Interpretation

- The main problem is matrix combinations of arrays and afterwards interpretation of numbers to match valid phone numbers, based on length and call code. 

- ArrayList of ArrayLists matrix.

- Array Matrices (`[][]`) of choice.


## Design Parameters

- inputs can only be up to 3 digits.

- inputs are numbers only

- IT SHOULD PRINT THE INPUT to the console

- phone numbers are 10 or 14 characters length

- when the user presses space this is another input

- check for validity via the intial code 210 or 003069

- input with zeros should be input with or without zeros.

- Afterwards it is only about ambiguities interpretation
